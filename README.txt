This app adds support to send Telegram messages from and to your Homey Pro.

How to setup

STEP 1
    Install the app
STEP 2
    Set up your own Telegram bot. This is fully secure and private, since you are the only one who can access the message archive. Enter @Botfather in the search tab of Telegram and choose the @Botfather bot.
STEP 3
    Click “Start” to activate @BotFather bot or enter /newbot. I recommend to set the bot to private (aka /setjoingroup to DISABLED) and to set the privacy to DISABLED (Send /setprivacy to @BotFather)
STEP 4
    Enter the Token inside the app settings
STEP 5
    Write your bot over Telegram /start and follow the instructions
    Each user has to also send the Bot the /start command. You can share the Bot via Telegram over the profile or search for the like u searched for the BotFather bot.
STEP 6
    Enjoy! :)
